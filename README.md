Coding Bootcamp Crystal Collectors by Alexander Lewis

Crystal Collector is a number strategy game in which the user attempts match a goal by collecting points from crystals. The goal is set by the computer and the crystal values are unknown to the user until they are selected during the game.

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript objects.
